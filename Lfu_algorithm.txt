Here is a pseudocode-type algorithm for the Least Frequently Used (LFU) page replacement algorithm, based on the program you provided:

### **Pseudocode for LFU Page Replacement Algorithm**

1. **Initialize variables:**
   - `n` ← number of pages
   - `page[]` ← array to store page reference string
   - `frameno` ← number of frames
   - `frame[]` ← initialize array of size `frameno` to -1
   - `count1[]` ← initialize array of size `frameno` to 0 (to store frequency counts)
   - `move` ← 0 (index for the next frame to fill)
   - `count` ← 0 (number of page faults)

2. **Input the number of pages**  
   Read `n`

3. **Input the page reference string**  
   For `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, read `page[i]`

4. **Input the number of frames**  
   Read `frameno`

5. **Initialize all frames to -1:**  
   For `i` from 0 to `frameno - 1`, set `frame[i]` to -1

6. **Iterate through each page reference:**
   - For `i` from 0 to `n - 1`:  
     - Print `page[i]`
     - `flag` ← 0 (to check if page is found)
   
     - **Check if the page is already in a frame:**
       - For `j` from 0 to `frameno - 1`:  
         - If `page[i]` equals `frame[j]`:  
           - `flag` ← 1  
           - Increment `count1[j]` (frequency of the page)  
           - Print "No replacement"  
           - Break

     - **If page is not found (`flag` is 0) and there is space in frames:**
       - If `count < frameno`:  
         - Set `frame[move]` ← `page[i]`  
         - Set `count1[move]` ← 1  
         - Increment `move` (circularly)  
         - Increment `count`  
         - Print the current frame status

     - **If page is not found and no space is available:**
       - Set `repindex` ← 0  
       - Set `leastcount` ← `count1[0]`
       - For `j` from 1 to `frameno - 1`:  
         - If `count1[j] < leastcount`:  
           - Set `repindex` ← `j`  
           - Set `leastcount` ← `count1[j]`
       - Replace the page:  
         - Set `frame[repindex]` ← `page[i]`  
         - Set `count1[repindex]` ← 1  
         - Increment `count`  
         - Print the current frame status

7. **Calculate fault rate:**  
   Set `rate` ← `count / n`

8. **Print results:**  
   Print the number of page faults (`count`)  
   Print the fault rate (`rate`)

### **Key Concepts:**
- **LFU Replacement:** The algorithm tracks the frequency of each page in memory and replaces the least frequently used one when needed.
- **Circular Replacement:** New pages are added using a circular index (`move`) until the frames are full.
- **Page Fault:** Occurs when a page is not found in the current set of frames and needs replacement.

This pseudocode provides a clear and structured representation of the LFU page replacement process.
